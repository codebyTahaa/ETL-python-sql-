ETL Pipeline for Data Processing
ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline is designed to efficiently extract raw data from various sources, transform it into a structured format, and load it into a target database or data warehouse. The project automates data integration, ensuring clean, consistent, and optimized data for analysis and reporting.
ðŸš€ Features

âœ… Data Extraction â€“ Fetch data from APIs, databases, and flat files (CSV, JSON, etc.).
âœ… Data Transformation â€“ Clean, normalize, and apply business logic to raw data.
âœ… Data Loading â€“ Store processed data in a structured format (SQL/NoSQL databases).
âœ… Error Handling & Logging â€“ Ensure data integrity with robust error tracking.
âœ… Scalability & Automation â€“ Designed for scalability with scheduling and parallel processing.
ðŸ”§ Technologies Used

    Programming Language: Python / SQL
    Data Processing: Pandas, NumPy
    Database: PostgreSQL / MySQL / MongoDB
    Workflow Automation: Apache Airflow / Luigi / Prefect
    Cloud & Storage: AWS S3 / Google Cloud Storage
